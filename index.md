# Pierce


Pierce is an upcoming testing infrastructure for neural network verification. At its core, Pierce implements a fuzzing engine over the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) (version 13) and the VNN-LIB standard. We leverage Pierce to create a diverse benchmark suite for the community. Furthermore, to demonstrate high usability as a testing infrastructure, we build a relative performance fuzzer and use it to expose slowdowns in four state-of-the-art solvers.

The project is named after Charles Peirce.
